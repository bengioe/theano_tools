# theano_tools
A set of hacks bundled into a library of deep learning theano boilerplate.

**Warning** This library is my personal set of theano boilerplate, python tools and experiment management code, and its "API" will change often. If you wish to use this, I recommend cloning your own version to avoid me breaking all your code.

You are free to copy, modify, or print this code on hand-made paper.
